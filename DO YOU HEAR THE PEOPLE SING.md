    Do you hear the people sing?                                        Do you hear the people sing?
    Lost in the valley of the night,                                    Loss of their leaders is the plight,
    It is a music of a people who are climbing to the light.            It is a music of a people who will not give up this fight.

    For the retched of the earth, there is a flame that never dies.     Dis-enfranchised of the earth, there is a power to your voice.
    Even the darkest night will end and sun will rise.                  Even the silent ones among us can move all with their choice.

    They will live again in freedom                                     They unionize their freedom
    In the garden of the Lord                                           In the compact of peoples
    They will walk behind the plough-share                              Our strength will grow in numbers
    They will put away the sword                                        Our will without the swords
    The chain will be broken                                            The chain can be broken
    And all men will have their reward!                                 That binds all from just awards!

    Will you join in our crusade?                                       Will you join in with Bernie?
    Who will be strong and stand with me?                               With all these Justice Democrats?

    Somewhere beyond the barricade                                      Somewhere beyond the primaries
    Is there a world you long to see?                                   Is there a hope you hold onto?
    Do you hear the people sing                                         Do you hear the people sing
    Say, do you hear the distant drums?                                 Say, do you hear the poll results?
    It is the future that they bring                                    Its been the longest since they mirror
    When tomorrow comes!                                                What leaders say!
    Will you join in our crusade?                                       Will you join in with Bernie?
    Who will be strong and stand with me?                               And these Justice Democrats?
    Somewhere beyond the barricade                                      Somewhere beyond the primaries

    Do you hear the people sing?                                        Do you hear the people sing?
    Singing the songs of angry men?                                     Singing of treason they have seen?
    It is the music of the people                                       It is a music of the peoples
    Who will not be slaves again!                                       Who will not be serfs longer!
    When the beating of your heart                                      When the beating of our hearts
    Echoes the beating of the drums                                     Echoes in hollows of each booth
    There is a life about to start                                      There is progress to be made
    When tomorrow comes!                                                When elections come!
    Will you join in our crusade?                                       Will you join in with Bernie?

    Then join in the fight                                              Then join in the fight
    That will give you the right to be free!                            that will knock out the blight of wealthy!
    Do you hear the people sing?                                        Do you hear the people sing?
    Singing the songs of angry men?                                     Singing of trials yet to come?
    It is the music of the people                                       It is a music of the peoples
    Who will not be slaves again!                                       Who will not be serfs longer!
    When the beating of your heart                                      When the beating of our hearts
    Echoes the beating of the drums                                     Echoes the the beating of our boots
    There is a life about to start                                      When Accounting has yet to start
    When tomorrow comes!                                                Demonstrators come!
    Will you give all you can give                                      Will you give all you can give
    So that our banner may advance                                      So that our voices are not mute?
    Some will fall and some will live                                   So might fall so that all will live?
    Will you stand up and take your chance?                             Will you stand up and take this stance?
    The blood of the martyrs                                            The marks of the voters
    Will water the meadows of France!                                   could let generations advance!
    Do you hear the people sing?                                        Do you hear the people sing?
    Singing the songs of angry men?                                     Singing of policy to come,
    It is the music of the people                                       It is a music of the people
    Who will not be slaves again!                                       Who will rule themselves again!
    When the beating of your heart                                      When the echos of your marks
    Echoes the beating of the drums                                     Are shown the leadership smarts
    There is a life about to start                                      There is progress to be made
    When tomorrow comes                                                 When elections come!
    Tomorrow comes!                                                     Elections come!
    Tomorrow comes!                                                     Elections come!
